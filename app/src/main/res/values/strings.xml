    <string name="about_content">A Developer Student Clubs is a Google recognised student body at a
        college which directly reports to Google for their activities and is supported by the tech
        giant.\n\n A DSC conducts workshops, seminars and other fun activities which help the students
        connect with Google.\n\n Developer Student Club KIET is inspired by Google Developers Family. We
        started our journey in Feb 2019. We try to engage student developers through our hack
        events, codelabs and meetups. The motive is to create a local ecosystem of programmers &amp;
        hackers in and around the Campus. The technology awareness is main goal for first few years
        of the group.
